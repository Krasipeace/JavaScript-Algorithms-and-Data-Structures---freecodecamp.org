### Object Oriented Programming

OOP, or Object Oriented Programming, is one of the major approaches to the software development process. In OOP, objects and classes organize code to describe things and what they can do.

In this course, you'll learn the basic principles of OOP in JavaScript, including the this keyword, prototype chains, constructors, and inheritance.

#### Exercises:

[Create a Basic JavaScript Object<br />
Use Dot Notation to Access the Properties of an Object<br />
Create a Method on an Object<br />

[Define a Constructor Function<br />
Use a Constructor to Create Objects<br />
Extend Constructors to Receive Arguments<br />
Verify an Object's Constructor with instanceof<br />
Understand Own Properties<br />
Use Prototype Properties to Reduce Duplicate Code<br />
Iterate Over All Properties<br />
Understand the Constructor Property<br />
Change the Prototype to a New Object<br />
Remember to Set the Constructor Property when Changing the Prototype<br />
